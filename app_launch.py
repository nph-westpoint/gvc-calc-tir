        interventions in people with diabetes have traditionally reported HbA1c as the measure of average 
        blood glucose levels for the 3 months preceding the HbA1c test date. The use of this measure 
        highlights the long-established correlation between HbA1c and relative risk of diabetes complications;
        the change in the measure, before and after the therapeutic intervention, is used by regulators for 
        the approval of medications for diabetes. However, with the increasing use of continuous glucose 
        monitoring (CGM) in clinical practice, prospective clinical studies are also increasingly using 
        CGM devices to collect data and evaluate glucose profiles among study participants, complementing
            HbA1c findings, and further assess the effects of therapeutic interventions on HbA1c. Data is 
            collected by CGM devices at 1–5 min intervals, which obtains data on glycaemic excursions and 
            periods of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia (ie, details of glycaemic control that 
            are not provided by HbA1c concentrations alone that are measured continuously and can be analysed 
            in daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes). These CGM-derived metrics are the subject of 
            standardised, internationally agreed reporting formats and should, therefore, be considered 
            for use in all clinical studies in diabetes. The purpose of this consensus statement is to 
            recommend the ways CGM data might be used in prospective clinical studies, either as a specified 
            study endpoint or as supportive complementary glucose metrics, to provide clinical information 
            that can be considered by investigators, regulators, companies, clinicians, and individuals with 
            diabetes who are stakeholders in trial outcomes. In this consensus statement, we provide 
            recommendations on how to optimise CGM-derived glucose data collection in clinical studies, 
            including the specific glucose metrics and specific glucose metrics that should be evaluated.

        for GV are the %Coefficient of Variation (%CV) and standard deviation (SD). The %CV is 
        correlated with risk of hypoglycemia. Graphical display of glucose by date, time of day,

        mean of daily differences, and average daily risk range. Some metrics are sensitive to the 
        frequency, periodicity, and complexity of glycemic fluctuations, including Fourier analysis, 
        periodograms, frequency spectrum, multiscale entropy (MSE), and Glucose Variability 
        Percentage (GVP). Fourier analysis indicates progressive changes from normal subjects to

        intimately related, and it is now evident that GV is important in both the physiology 
        and pathophysiology of diabetes. However, its quantitative assessment is complex because 
        blood glucose (BG) fluctuations are characterized by both amplitude and timing. Additional 
        numerical complications arise from the asymmetry of the BG scale. In this Perspective, 
        we focus on the acute manifestations of GV, particularly on hypoglycemia, and review 
        measures assessing the amplitude of GV from routine self-monitored BG data, as well as 
        its timing from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. With availability of CGM, the 
        latter is not only possible but also a requirement—we can now assess rapid glucose 
        fluctuations in real time and relate their speed and magnitude to clinically relevant outcomes. 
        Our primary message is that diabetes control is all about optimization and balance between 
        two key markers—frequency of hypoglycemia and HbA1c reflecting average BG and primarily 
        driven by the extent of hyperglycemia. GV is a primary barrier to this optimization, 
        including to automated technologies such as the “artificial pancreas.” Thus, it is time to 
        standardize GV measurement and thereby streamline the assessment of its two most 
        important components—amplitude and timing."""
